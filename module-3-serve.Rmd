For this exercise, we have already created a function for you that uses some of the magic of the Tidyverse to convert a dataset from long to wide, or vice versa. This function

The R code for this function, with the approprate plumber markup is in `myrestapi.R`.

In this workbook, we will start serving the API with the function.

You must run this workbook in a separate RStudio sesson.

```{r}
api <- plumber::plumb("myrestapi.R")
api$run(host = "127.0.0.1", port = 8000)
```
